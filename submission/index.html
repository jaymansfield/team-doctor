<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigation</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		<b>Patient Privacy</b><br />
		Patient privacy and confidentiality is extremely important and is always a major risk in healthcare. The following actions should be taken to mitigate the risk.

		<ul>
			<li>Implement Auditing - Audit (record) all actions performed by users in the application so that there is a record of all access to patientâ€™s PHI (personal health information).</li>
			<li>Anonymous Patients - If consultants are only providing advice remotely and do not interact with the patients directly they do not need to know the patients name they are providing advice for.
			<li>Secure Web Services - Add an additional firewall between the application server and web services to create another DMZ. </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Availability</b><br />
		The team doctor system must maintain an availability of 99.99%. The following actions should be taken to mitigate the risk.

		<ul>
			<li>Web Services SLA - Any failure on the three web services will cause a disruption to the team doctor system. The providers of the three web services should provide a SLA with a 99.99% availability.</li>
			<li>Test Availability - The system and failover (hot standbys) needs to be tested frequently to ensure availability. </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Performance</b><br />
		
		<ul>
			<li>Caching - A caching system could be implemented to reduce the number of web service calls and improve performance in the loading &amp; viewing of requests.</li>
			<li>Sizing Servers - More time could be spent sizing the web servers appropriately. Different configurations need to be tested and compared to determine what we handle all non functional requirements. </li>
			<li>Web Services SLA - The providers of the three web services should provide a SLA to meet required performance requirements.</li>
			<li>Test Performance - The system needs to be tested frequently simulating both regular traffic and peak loads to ensure performance.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Authentication is handled by the container.</li>
	<li>Consultants can be experts at multiple subject matters (multiple specializations). </li>
	<li>All prescription and patient history data are in plain text and all rich content are in binary.</li>
	<li>Rich content is transmitted over web service with base64 encoding.</li>
	<li>The three web services are located in the same private network as the application servers.</li>
</ul>
